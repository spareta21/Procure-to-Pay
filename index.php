					<br>Siloed, fragmented procurement software complicates the procure-to-pay process. Outdated procurement solutions are expensive, inflexible, and inefficient. Still, most organizations continue to ‘make do’ with their old-fashioned procurement software.<br><br>

According to a Paystream 2018 Procurement Insights report, 80% of organizations still use manual or semi-digital tools to manage their procure-to-pay cycle. Most organizations are using the procurement module integrated with their ERP or accounting software. This is similar to using a flashlight to crack a nut. Although it gets the work done, it is still not the right tool.
<br><br>

Before long, this misapplication will stir up trouble. The consequences of using archaic procure-to-pay software, or worse, no solution at all, will ultimately damage an organization’s bottom line. In order to survive the competition, organizations need to move away from their traditional approach and embrace the right procurement technology.<br><br>

Here’s all you need to know about choosing the right procure-to-pay solution, to make your procure-to-pay process truly effective.<br>
					<h3>What is Procure to Pay Process ? </h3>
					<hr width="80%" align="left" style="border-width:3px; margin-top:-10px;">
					The Procure-to-Pay is a process in which an organization purchases the raw materials and services which are required to do business. It is the process of requisitioning, purchasing, receiving, paying and accounting for goods and services. It involves the number of sequential stages, ranging from need identification to invoice approvals and vendor payment.<br><br>
